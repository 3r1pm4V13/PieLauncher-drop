# Pie Launcher

Android home screen launcher that uses a pie menu for your most used apps
instead of an app bar at the bottom of the screen.

Swipe to open the pie menu and choose an app to start.
Tap and type the name of an app you don't use regularily.

As soon as you're used to it, you can open your most used apps with muscle
memory anywhere on your screen without even looking at it.
